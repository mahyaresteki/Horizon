# Horizon Research Project (HRP)
Horizon is a web-based application designed to manage project information, human resources, and allocated resources in companies. It aims to improve employee satisfaction, accelerate project progress, and boost productivity in task management. By organizing information efficiently, Horizon helps technology companies balance individual and collective interests, creating a healthier and more productive work environment.

## What is Horizon System?
Horizon System is an organizational software designed to enhance both job satisfaction and performance in technology companies. By analyzing project workflows and employee engagement, this system evaluates job satisfaction based on comprehensive indicators while also monitoring work performance.

The primary goal of this project is to simultaneously improve operational efficiency and ethical standards within tech companies. Horizon System helps align the interests of employers and employees, fostering a collaborative environment where mutual satisfaction and productivity grow hand in hand. Ultimately, this approach contributes to elevating labor rights and human rights standards in the industry.

Insights from this research project will support senior managers in optimizing business performance by enhancing both individual and organizational well-being.

## How Does Horizon System Work?
Horizon System assesses job satisfaction and performance using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods. Key approaches include:

1. Employee Surveys & Feedback: Regular surveys help gather insights on job satisfaction, workplace culture, and team dynamics.
2. Project Workflow Analysis: By tracking task completion times, collaboration patterns, and workload distribution, the system identifies areas for improvement.
3. Performance Metrics: The system evaluates productivity trends and employee engagement based on real work data.
Ethical & Social Impact Indicators – Workplace inclusivity, work-life balance, and adherence to labor rights standards are measured to ensure a fair work environment.

By integrating these methods, Horizon System provides actionable insights for both employees and managers, fostering a healthier and more efficient work environment.

## Story of the Project
At first, the Horizon project was supposed to be a platform for the production of a payment switch with high flexibility. It was decided that any development method and pattern that seems inefficient should be investigated before using or rejecting it. But then something strange happened! During the research, it was found that current development methods in most cases ignore the human rights of developers in order to achieve maximum efficiency.

Creating new applications and providing technical solutions always has many fans and technology companies pay good wages for such systems! But, we chose to walk in a path that others have not yet been willing to talk about. As a result, the Horizon project changed its path towards investigating management deficiencies in the world of technology. The goal of the Horizon project is to create a new management solution based on ethical principles in such a way that in addition to maintaining and improving efficiency, the human rights of the employees involved in the project are also respected.

Therefore, the Horizon project is a humanitarian research activity aimed at creating methods to improve efficiency without violating the rights of employees.

## Use of AI Assistants in the Horizon Project
As part of the Horizon project development, AI assistants were used to improve the quality and efficiency of both content creation and design tasks. The following tools were utilized:

### ChatGPT – AI Assistant for Content Writing
We used ChatGPT to assist in drafting, editing, and refining textual content for the project. This AI model helped:
* Enhance clarity and coherence in descriptions
* Maintain a consistent and professional tone
* Generate structured content such as objectives, summaries, and feature explanations
ChatGPT supported the writing process while ensuring conceptual accuracy and alignment with the project’s goals.

### Recraft – AI Assistant for Logo Design
For the project’s visual identity, Recraft (an AI-powered design tool) was used to:
* Generate logo design ideas aligned with the project’s theme and values
* Explore various creative concepts quickly and efficiently
* Refine and finalize the logo based on iterative AI-generated suggestions
Recraft enabled the team to experiment with visual directions and produce a logo that represents Horizon’s mission and identity.

## Research Team
Horizon will be developed by ZURVAN research team which is managed by [Mahyar Esteki](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahyaresteki/).

In the Middle Persian language ([Pahlavi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Persian)), "ZURVAN" means God of time and destiny.

## Research Progress Philosophy
The research progress philosophy of the Horizon project is based on [Kaizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen). Therefore, we will accept any logical and scientific critique or suggestion that helps to improve the project.
