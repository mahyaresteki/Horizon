<h1>Horizon Research Project (HRP)</h1>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Organizational Productivity and Justice Management System</p>
</div>
Horizon is a web-based application designed to manage project information, human resources, and allocated resources in companies. It aims to improve employee satisfaction, accelerate project progress, and boost productivity in task management. By organizing information efficiently, Horizon helps technology companies balance individual and collective interests, creating a healthier and more productive work environment.

## What is Horizon System?
Horizon System is a lightweight yet integrated "_**total evaluation solution**_" designed to analyze organizational projects across three key dimensions: financial performance, human resources, and project execution.

By collecting and analyzing relevant data from ongoing workflows, contracts, and employee activity, Horizon provides a comprehensive view of both job satisfaction and operational effectiveness. This multi-dimensional approach allows organizations to evaluate not only how work is being done, but also how it impacts the well-being and motivation of their teams.

The core mission of Horizon is to align organizational performance with ethical labor practices. By fostering transparency and shared understanding between employees and management, Horizon helps build a healthier, more collaborative work environment.

Ultimately, insights generated by Horizon support decision-makers in improving business outcomes while advancing labor rights and human dignity in the tech industry.

## How Does Horizon System Work?
Horizon System assesses job satisfaction and performance using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods. Key approaches include:

1. **Employee Surveys & Feedback:** Regular surveys help gather insights on job satisfaction, workplace culture, and team dynamics.
2. **Project Workflow Analysis:** By tracking task completion times, collaboration patterns, and workload distribution, the system identifies areas for improvement.
3. **Performance Metrics:** The system evaluates productivity trends and employee engagement based on real work data.
Ethical & Social Impact Indicators – Workplace inclusivity, work-life balance, and adherence to labor rights standards are measured to ensure a fair work environment.

By integrating these methods, Horizon System provides actionable insights for both employees and managers, fostering a healthier and more efficient work environment.

## Horizon Extension Engine
To minimize redundant manual input and maximize interoperability, Horizon introduces the Extension Engine — a lightweight, pluggable integration system that connects your existing tools and workflows directly to Horizon’s core analytics platform.

With Horizon Extension Engine, you can effortlessly sync data from popular platforms, such as:

1. GitLab, GitHub, Bitbucket – for project and development metrics
2. Jira, Trello, Asana – for task and workflow tracking
3. Google Sheets, Excel, Notion – for financial or resource-related data
4. Email & Calendar tools – to estimate communication loads and time allocation
5. Custom APIs & internal systems – for tailored enterprise integrations

**Key Features:**
1. Modular Plug-ins: Install only what you need. Each connector works independently.
2. Auto-sync & On-demand Pulling: Keep Horizon updated in real time or via scheduled syncs.
3. Secure & Minimal Footprint: Built with privacy and lightweight deployment in mind.
4. Customizable & Open Source: Easily extend with your own scripts or data adapters.

The Extension Engine allows Horizon to act not as another siloed system, but as a holistic analytical layer over your organization’s existing infrastructure — combining HR, financial, and project metrics into one coherent picture.
