# Horizon Research Project (HRP)
Horizon is a web-based application designed to manage project information, human resources, and technology-related assets in companies. It aims to improve employee satisfaction, accelerate project progress, and boost productivity in task management. By organizing information efficiently, Horizon helps technology companies balance individual and collective interests, creating a healthier and more productive work environment.

## What is Horizon System?
Horizon System is an organizational software designed to enhance both job satisfaction and performance in technology companies. By analyzing project workflows and employee engagement, this system evaluates job satisfaction based on comprehensive indicators while also monitoring work performance.

The primary goal of this project is to simultaneously improve operational efficiency and ethical standards within tech companies. Horizon System helps align the interests of employers and employees, fostering a collaborative environment where mutual satisfaction and productivity grow hand in hand. Ultimately, this approach contributes to elevating labor rights and human rights standards in the industry.

Insights from this research project will support senior managers in optimizing business performance by enhancing both individual and organizational well-being.

## How Does Horizon System Work?
Horizon System assesses job satisfaction and performance using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods. Key approaches include:

1. Employee Surveys & Feedback: Regular surveys help gather insights on job satisfaction, workplace culture, and team dynamics.
2. Project Workflow Analysis: By tracking task completion times, collaboration patterns, and workload distribution, the system identifies areas for improvement.
3. Performance Metrics: The system evaluates productivity trends and employee engagement based on real work data.
Ethical & Social Impact Indicators â€“ Workplace inclusivity, work-life balance, and adherence to labor rights standards are measured to ensure a fair work environment.

By integrating these methods, Horizon System provides actionable insights for both employees and managers, fostering a healthier and more efficient work environment.

## Story of the Project
At first, the Horizon project was supposed to be a platform for the production of a payment switch with high flexibility. It was decided that any development method and pattern that seems inefficient should be investigated before using or rejecting it. But then something strange happened! During the research, it was found that current development methods in most cases ignore the human rights of developers in order to achieve maximum efficiency.

Creating new applications and providing technical solutions always has many fans and technology companies pay good wages for such systems! But, we chose to walk in a path that others have not yet been willing to talk about. As a result, the Horizon project changed its path towards investigating management deficiencies in the world of technology. The goal of the Horizon project is to create a new management solution based on ethical principles in such a way that in addition to maintaining and improving efficiency, the human rights of the employees involved in the project are also respected.

Therefore, the Horizon project is a humanitarian research activity aimed at creating methods to improve efficiency without violating the rights of employees.

## Research Type
Based on definitions of [Lawrence Berkeley	National	Laboratory](https://www.sjsu.edu/people/fred.prochaska/courses/ScWk170/s0/Basic-vs.-Applied-Research.pdf), this project is an **"applied research"**.

## Objectives
Horizon Research Project (HRP) focuses on the following main objectives.

1. Is it possible to use a methodology in the software development process that in addition to improving the development process and product implementation, the interests of all project stakeholders fairly provided and social principles observed throughout the project?
2. Is it possible to ensure the human rights of the employees during the project without interfering with the project obligations?
3. Can this model become a permanent culture in the organization?
