# Horizon Payment Switch
Horizon Payment Switch is research and development project to create an free and open source payment switch based on "Distrbuted Open Banking Theory". It will be developed by Python programming language. Horizon is a payment approach with distributed database which is following ISO 8583 standard. It will be a script based payment switch to implement changes with minimum cost. Horizon will be connected to any gateway and terminal by REST services. It will try to achive an appropriate transactions per second (TPS) rate.

## Project Status
The project status is "underdevelopment".

## Goal of the Project
Main goal of the Horizon project is development of flexible, lightweight, configurable,  faster and open source ISO-8583 compatible payment acquiree switch for banking and fintech system.

## Advantages
1 - Including ESB (REST communication)

2 - Configurable

3 - Flexible Error Handling

4 - Lightweight

5 - Open Source

6 - High Speed

7 - Easy to Use

## Research Goals and Questions
1 - Is it possible to develop a RESTful payment switch based on ISO 8583 which can convert ISO message to REST format and vice versa with minimum process?  

2 - Is it possible to create a payment switch based on ISO 8583 standard which clients can inquery format of specific message (ex: input and output for 0200 request message type) for the switch?

3 - Is it possible to create a flexible RESTful payment switch which aministrators can map ISO fields to JSON parameters without restarting or switching off payment gateway or switch?

4 - Is it posible to develop a payment switch which uses RESTful (HTTP) and socket programming (TCP) connection methods at a same time to provide payment services for deferent types of clients (ex: ATM and mobile app server)?
