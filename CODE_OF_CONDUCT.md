## Horizon Code of Conduct
This project has adopted the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/)

# Contributor Covenant: A Code of Conduct for Digital Communities
Contributor Covenant is the most widely adopted open source code of conduct in the world. It helps your community express its unique core values while setting clear expectations for how people should treat one another. Adopting Contributor Covenant signals your commitment to creating a welcoming and safe environment for everyone.

## Philosophy & Purpose
A healthy community is sustained by its shared values. While every community is different, there are fundamental principles and norms that are essential to fostering a culture of belonging and inclusion. Since its inception in 2014, Contributor Covenant has always promoted the belief that everyone benefits when our implicit values are made explicit.
